--Readme document for Jeslyn Nguyen, jeslynbn@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 2/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- at least one img with al text (in home page, work page)
- adding custom icon from google material icons (menu icon)
- semantic HTML tags (header, footer, nav)
- multiple pages with appropriate navigation between them (home, work(s), contact)
- links to external pages (in footer instagram icon points to instagram website)

(b) CSS features
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability (using vh)
- Modified link text in work, specific work pages, and contact page so when user hovers it underlines link
- using Google Sans font

(c) Advanced features
- navigation bar that is responsive, includes sidebar
- contact form using boostrap (doesn't work yet though)

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
 I got a lot of potential warning across all my html files. Most were related to the images concerning alt text and type of image. A few names of my classes were also flagged and other small concerns, but I don't think they required me to change anything since they had little affect on the pages.
 Regarding accessibility, the warnings were targetting things (like images, titles) that I tried to make accessible (adding alt text or ""), and with the code the one valid thing I could find was the site map warning which can affect the readability of the code, which I would change if there were multiple people working on the project but for this one I decided not to.
 Some examples:
    - Alt text does not convey the same information as the image: Looks at my image name but even though some are similar it doesn't match correctly. 
    - Alt text is not empty and image may be decorative: 1 image on the home page is decorative but the rest need alt text.
